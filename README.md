# Data-Structures

This repo is going to have 5 data structures implementations. as written below
Each data structure is going to have it own file.

data structures store in formation of various types
some of the data types are, 
Arrays - multiple values can be stored in a single array as a single variable

Stack - uses the LIFO principal, an item can only be added and removed from the one end.

Queues - uses the FIFO principal, an item can only be added from one end and removed from the other end.

Linked Lists - linear data structure which is a collection of data elements also known as nodes and can have varying sizes. listed items are connected through a pointer which is known as a link

Graphs - used to solve complex problems. used to model the relationships between key/value pairs.
        graphs can be traversed in one of two ways: depth-first or breadth-first

Trees - highly used for hierarchical data structures, has the root node and othe nodes

Heap -  used for solving graph algorithms with efficiency and also in sorting

Set - used to store information, in any particular order but it should not repeat in a set.used to check the existance of a file.
